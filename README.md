# Web-Scraping-Scripts

These are just a few samples of my webscraping scripts. 


Stock_Retriever uses Yahoo_finance.com for data. 


News_Reader is applicable to almost any website, just be sure to change the HTML tag. (Inspect page to ascertain said information) Be sure to delete MP3 and txt files after.
